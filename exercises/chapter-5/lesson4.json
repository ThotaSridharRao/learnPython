    "concept": "Using Loops Inside Loops",
    "introduction": "A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop. Itâ€™s useful for grids, tables, or patterns.",
    "explanation": "The outer loop runs once, and each time it runs, the inner loop runs completely. This is often used in printing patterns or working with 2D data.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Nested loops are loops inside loops",
      "Indent the inner loop more than the outer",
      "Useful for patterns, grids, tables"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "for i in range(3):\n    for j in range(2):\n        print(i, j)",
        "explanation": "Prints pair combinations"
      }
    ],
    "importantNotes": [
      "ðŸ’¡ Be careful with indentation â€” each loop needs its block",
      "ðŸ§  Use `print(\"*\", end=\"\")` to print on the same line"

    "starterCode": "# Use nested loops to build the pattern\n",
    "hints": [
      "Use outer loop for rows, inner for stars",
      "Use `print('*', end='')` inside inner loop",
      "Add `print()` after inner loop to go to the next line"
