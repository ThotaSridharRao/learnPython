    "concept": "Looping Until a Condition is False",
    "introduction": "A `while` loop keeps running as long as a condition is true. It's useful when you don’t know how many times you’ll need to repeat.",
    "explanation": "Unlike `for`, the `while` loop checks a condition before every run. If the condition is still true, it repeats the block. You must update something inside the loop, or it could run forever!",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Use `while condition:` to start a loop",
      "The condition is checked every time",
      "Be careful to avoid infinite loops"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "count = 1\nwhile count <= 3:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1",
        "explanation": "Prints 1, 2, 3 and then exits the loop"
      }
    ],
    "importantNotes": [
      "❗ Change your variable inside the loop or it won’t stop",
      "💡 `while True:` creates an infinite loop (needs `break`) if not handled",
      "🧠 Good for unknown repetitions (e.g., until user exits)"
