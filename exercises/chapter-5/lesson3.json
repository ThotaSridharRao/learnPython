    "concept": "Controlling Loops with break and continue",
    "introduction": "`break` and `continue` help you control when to stop or skip parts of a loop.",
    "explanation": "`break` stops the loop completely, even if the condition is still true. `continue` skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "`break` exits the loop early",
      "`continue` skips the current step",
      "You can use them in both `for` and `while` loops"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "for i in range(5):\n    if i == 3:\n        break\n    print(i)",
        "explanation": "`break` exits the loop when `i == 3`"
      },
      {
        "code": "for i in range(5):\n    if i == 2:\n        continue\n    print(i)",
        "explanation": "`continue` skips printing when `i == 2`"
      }

    "importantNotes": [
      "‚ö†Ô∏è Use `break` to avoid infinite loops when needed",
