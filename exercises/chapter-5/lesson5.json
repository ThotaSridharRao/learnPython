    "concept": "Choosing the Right Loop and Writing Clean Code",
    "introduction": "Loops are powerful â€” but choosing the right type and keeping them clean is key to writing good code.",
    "explanation": "Use `for` when you know how many times to repeat. Use `while` when you loop until something happens. Avoid unnecessary nesting and infinite loops. Always update loop variables properly.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "`for` = known count, `while` = unknown count",
      "Use `break` for early exits, `continue` for skips",
      "Keep indentation clean and avoid too much nesting",
      "Check that your loops always have an exit condition"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "for i in range(5):\n    print(i)",
        "explanation": "Use `for` when the number of iterations is known"
      },
      {
        "code": "while True:\n    response = input(\"Type 'exit': \")\n    if response == 'exit':\n        break",
        "explanation": "Use `while` when waiting for a condition"
      }

    "importantNotes": [
      "ðŸ§  Comment your loop logic to improve readability",
      "ðŸ’¡ Test loops with small values before full runs",
      "âœ… Avoid infinite loops unless intentional (with `break`)"

      "Use `range(1, 4)` for the for loop",
