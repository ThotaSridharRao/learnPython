    "concept": "Understanding Variables in Python",
    "introduction": "Variables are like containers that hold data. You use them to store values and use them later in your code.",
    "explanation": "In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable. You just assign a value using the equals sign `=`. Once assigned, you can use the variable name to refer to the value stored inside it.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Variables are created when you assign a value using `=`",
      "Variable names must start with a letter or underscore",
      "Python is dynamically typed ‚Äî no need to declare types",
      "Variables can hold numbers, text, or any data type"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "name = \"Shridhar\"\nprint(name)",
        "explanation": "This creates a variable called `name` and prints its value"
      },
      {
        "code": "x = 10\ny = 5\nprint(x + y)",
        "explanation": "You can store numbers in variables and use them in expressions"
      }
    ],
    "importantNotes": [
      "üí° Variable names are case-sensitive (`name` ‚â† `Name`)",
      "‚ùå You can't use spaces or symbols in variable names",
      "‚úÖ Use descriptive names like `age`, `score`, not `x1`"
    ]
  },
  "task": {
    "objective": "Create a variable and print its value",
    "description": "Declare a variable named `your_name` and store your name in it. Then print it using the print function.",
    "expectedOutput": "My name is Shridhar!",
    "starterCode": "# Store your name in a variable called your_name\n# Then print it\n",
    "hints": [
      "Use `=` to assign a value to the variable",
      "Wrap your name in quotes (it‚Äôs a string)",
      "Use `print()` to display the message"
    ]
  },
  "validation": {

      "your_name = \"Shridhar\"\nprint(\"My name is \" + your_name + \"!\")",
