    "introduction": "Welcome to Python! You're about to write your first program - the famous 'Hello, World!' This is a tradition that every programmer follows when learning a new language.",
    "explanation": "Python is a powerful yet beginner-friendly programming language. It's used by companies like Google, Netflix, and Instagram. The print() function is your first tool - it displays text on the screen.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Python is case-sensitive (print vs Print)",
      "The print() function displays text to the console",
      "Text (strings) must be enclosed in quotes",
      "You can use single ' or double \" quotes"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "print('Hello, World!')",
        "explanation": "This displays 'Hello, World!' on the screen"
      },
      {
        "code": "print(\"Welcome to Python!\")",
        "explanation": "Double quotes work the same as single quotes"
      }
    ],
    "importantNotes": [
      "ðŸ’¡ Python is case-sensitive! 'print' works, but 'Print' or 'PRINT' will cause an error",
      "ðŸ”¤ Always put text inside quotes - either 'text' or \"text\"",
      "âš¡ Press Ctrl+Enter to run your code quickly"

    "expectedOutput": "Hello, World!",
    "starterCode": "# Write your Python code here\n# Try: print('Hello, World!')\n",
    "hints": [
      "Use the print() function",
      "Put 'Hello, World!' inside quotes",
      "Make sure 'print' is lowercase",
