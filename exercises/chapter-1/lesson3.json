    "concept": "Python Comments & Interactive Mode",
    "introduction": "Comments are ignored by Python but are useful for explaining your code. The interactive shell (REPL) lets you test small pieces of code instantly.",
    "explanation": "Use `#` for single-line comments. Multi-line comments can be simulated with triple quotes, although they are usually just string literals. The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) runs Python one line at a time and is great for experimenting.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Use `#` to add a comment",
      "Triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) can hold multi-line notes",
      "Comments do not affect code execution",
      "The REPL is started using `python` or `python3` in terminal"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "# This is a single-line comment\nprint(\"Hi\")",
        "explanation": "Only the print() line runs"
      },
      {
        "code": "'''\nThis is a\nmulti-line comment\n'''\nprint(\"Hello\")",
        "explanation": "Triple quotes can be used as block comments"
      }
    ],
    "importantNotes": [
      "üß† Use comments to explain why, not what the code does",
      "‚ùå Don‚Äôt overuse comments ‚Äî clean code is better",
      "üíª Use the REPL to test expressions quickly (`python` in terminal)"
