    "introduction": "You've learned how to print, write comments, and structure Python code. Now itâ€™s time to combine everything and write your first small script.",
    "explanation": "Python scripts are just plain text files with `.py` extension. They can contain comments, multiple print statements, and logic. Good scripts are readable, organized, and informative.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Use comments to describe what your code does",
      "Group related logic with indentation",
      "Use blank lines to keep your code clean"

    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "# This program prints two messages\nprint(\"Python is fun!\")\nprint(\"Let's keep learning!\")",
        "explanation": "Simple script using comments and multiple print statements"
      }

    "importantNotes": [
      "ðŸ§  It's okay to make mistakes â€” errors are part of learning!",
