  "theory": {
    "concept": "Understanding Python Syntax and Indentation",
    "introduction": "Python is famous for its clean and readable syntax. It uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define blocks of code, rather than braces like many other languages.",
    "explanation": "Unlike languages like C or Java, Python relies on indentation to define blocks of code such as loops, conditionals, and functions. This makes the code easier to read but also means you must be consistent with your spacing.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to group code",
      "Indentation level must be consistent within a block",
      "Each block of code typically indents 4 spaces",
      "Colons `:` indicate the start of an indented block"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "if True:\n    print(\"Indented correctly\")",
        "explanation": "This is a valid if-statement with proper indentation"
      },
      {
        "code": "if True:\nprint(\"Missing indentation\")",
        "explanation": "‚ùå This will cause an IndentationError"
      }
    ],
    "importantNotes": [
      "üß† Consistency is key ‚Äî don‚Äôt mix tabs and spaces",
      "‚ùå Python will raise an error if indentation is wrong",
      "üí° Use 4 spaces per level (most editors do this by default)"
    ],
    "references": [
      "https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation"
    ]
  },
  "task": {
    "objective": "Write an if statement that uses correct indentation",
    "description": "Practice writing a simple if-statement that correctly uses indentation to print a message.",
    "expectedOutput": "Python is awesome!",
    "starterCode": "# Fix the indentation below\nif True:\nprint(\"Python is awesome!\")",
    "hints": [
      "Use 4 spaces to indent the print statement",
      "Make sure the print line is indented under the if line",
      "Don‚Äôt forget the colon `:` at the end of the if statement"

      {
        "error": "if True:\n        print(\"Python is awesome!\")",
        "message": "Too much indentation can be confusing. Use exactly 4 spaces."
