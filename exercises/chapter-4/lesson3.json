    "concept": "Using if Inside Another if",
    "introduction": "You can place one `if` statement inside another. This is called nesting, and it helps handle more detailed decisions.",
    "explanation": "When you need to check a second condition only if the first one is true, nest the second `if` block inside the first. Each nested block must be indented further.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Nested conditionals are useful for multi-step logic",
      "Each inner block is indented more than its parent",
      "Avoid over-nesting â€” it makes code harder to read"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "score = 90\nif score > 50:\n    if score >= 90:\n        print(\"Excellent!\")",
        "explanation": "The second condition is only checked if the first is true"
      }
    ],
    "importantNotes": [
      "ðŸ“Œ Each level of nesting increases indentation",
      "ðŸ§  Only write the inner `if` when truly needed",
      "âœ… Nesting is powerful but should be used wisely"

  "task": {
    "objective": "Write a nested if statement to check multiple conditions",
    "description": "Create a variable `age = 20`. If age is 18 or more, check if it is also 21 or more. Print 'Adult' if 18+, and 'Can drink' if 21+.",
    "expectedOutput": "Adult\n",
    "starterCode": "# Use nested if blocks\n",
    "hints": [
      "Use one `if` inside another",
      "Only print 'Can drink' if age is 21 or more",
      "Ensure indentation is correct"
