    "concept": "Making Decisions with if",
    "introduction": "The `if` statement allows Python to make decisions and run certain code only when a condition is true.",
    "explanation": "Write a condition after `if` followed by a colon. Then indent the code you want to run if that condition is true. If the condition is false, the code is skipped.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Use `if` followed by a condition and a colon `:`",
      "Indent the block you want to run if the condition is true",
      "Conditions return a Boolean: `True` or `False`"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "age = 18\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"You are an adult.\")",
        "explanation": "The code inside `if` runs only if the condition is true"
      }
    ],
    "importantNotes": [
      "❗ Indentation is required after `if`",
      "✅ Conditions can use comparison operators like `>=`, `==`, etc.",
      "💡 You can use variables or direct values in conditions"
