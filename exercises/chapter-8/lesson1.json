    "concept": "Using input() to Get Data from the User",
    "introduction": "`input()` allows your program to accept user input during execution. It's how you make interactive programs.",
    "explanation": "When `input()` runs, Python waits for the user to type something. Whatever they type is returned as a string. You can store it in a variable.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Use `input(\"Prompt\")` to show a message to the user",
      "The result is always a string, even if numbers are typed",
      "Use `int()` or `float()` to convert input if needed"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "name = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name)",

      "Use `input(\"What's your favorite color? \")`",
