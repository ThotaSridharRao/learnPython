    "concept": "Using `open()` to Read a File",
    "introduction": "Python can read data from files using the `open()` function. This is useful for loading content like settings, data, or text.",
    "explanation": "Use `open('filename.txt')` in read mode (`'r'`). Use `.read()` to get the full content, or `.readlines()` to get a list of lines. Always close the file after reading, or use `with open()`.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Use `with open(filename) as f:` to safely open files",
      "Use `.read()` or `.readlines()` to get file content",
      "Make sure the file exists in the same folder"
    ],
    "codeExamples": [
      {
        "code": "with open(\"demo.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)",
        "explanation": "Opens a file and prints all its content"
      }
    ],
    "importantNotes": [
      "üìå Always use `with` to avoid forgetting to close the file",
